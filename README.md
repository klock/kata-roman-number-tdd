# Kata Roman Numbers TDD
TDD experienced with the kata Roman Numbers

This project aims to record my steps when working on the kata [Roman Numbers](http://codingdojo.org/kata/RomanCalculator) following the Test Driven Development methodology.


## TDD 

### The 3 rules
- No production code, unless if it fix a failing test
- No more test code than the minimum to make it fail
(don't forget that: _not compiling is failing_)
- No more production code than the minimum to fix the failing test

### Mantra : Fail Fix Refactor
- Write failing test
- Fix test by writing code
- Refactor if needed

### Baby steps
- One change at a time


## Install

`git clone`

`npm install`

## Run tests

- run tests once

`npm run test`

- run tests watching for modifications

`npm run test-watch`
